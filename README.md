# Movie-Recommendation-System

## Project description:

The created movie recommendation system offers recommendations based on the movie genre for a new user, user a selects movies from the default set attributes (they are set randomly because the user does not have a search history at the beginning), and then recommends movies based on the weight of the attribute ratings. The system determines the user’s preferences by K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The system can also handle new users and products using a cold start strategy. Using knowledge-based and content-based collaboration methods, an algorithm was created based on the idea of ”If you like something, you will also like something similar.“ This is calculated through accuracy metrics precison and recall. If the database for recommendation systems contains several films, the accuracy of the system will be higher. If the database is large, the accuracy is usually lower because the amount of information requested is too large. By the nature of our system, it is not an easy task to evaluate the performance since there is no right or wrong recommendation; it is just a matter of opinions. This work is a fairly useful and effective approach to recommending movies, which can potentially increase user satisfaction
